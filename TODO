- How to manage names between scripts?
  - Naming scheme must be hierarchal & stable
    e.g. "/memcached/logs/latest"
  - Directly on top of file-system?
  - Want to be able define new ad-hoc collections of data
- Overnight jobs (using barley?)
- Compare data across runs in spite of different addresses
  - Disbale ASLR?
    - What about mmap/malloc calls?
  - Investigate variability between different runs
    - Take average of page counts across several runs?
- Define higher-level tasks (simple bash or python scripts?)
- Wrapper around python matplotlib
- Retain thread-level traces (i.e. don't do thread => process aggregation in pin module)
- Add timing information to trace
- Store command(-line arguments) that generated trace
- User-level named plots for different runs (similar to user-level named collections?)
